Yeah, the four kingdom thing kind of works out well as a number, heh.
3 is good too, but eh four works
Need to pick four cultures that did sort of coexist at one point in history
Like the Chinese, Mongols... Maybe some european influence
But they can't be too different or an alliance wont be very believable
Maybe like... 

1. Japanese / honor-based culture , lot of exotic weapons and a focus on lightning damage

2. Mongol / Horselord plains wanderers who recently settled down. Focus on defensive gear and heavy weapons

3. Nordic farming/academic society, focus on religion, healing, magic

Ooo maybe a greek culture; warm air, fanciful religion, very academically focused, lightweight  weapons but strong support magic.

Midlanders - farmers of the central plains

Basis: 

--------------------------------------
Jagor - Beast riders of the North
--------------------------------------
Basis: Mongols

Values:
- Might makes right
- Those who are not self-sufficient are fools who do not deserve to survive
- Extended family not valued but immediate family ties (parents, siblings, children) are scared

Culture: 
- Leader known as the Jag
- Cold climate in the northern steppes
- Horselike beasts as pets
- mobile tent villages
- Superstitious but little serious interest in religion
- Little to no formal education, but scholars who can supply practical results from other cultures are highly valued
- Live off the land, sheep/goats for milk and meat
- During the creation of wishes the Jag's emisaries informed the king the Jag wanted to split the wish into four and give each kingdom, even brought a great chest to haul the expected great wish piece back in.
- After the destruction of the great wish they pulled back their mostly mobile villages into the mountains of their steppes, leaving the great beasts and demons to spread across the steppes. As time went on, they slowly took back parts of their former land, but the majority of the stepps is filled with high level critters and the remains of their great temples where the former Jags were buried
- Greatest heroes kept demons as pets
