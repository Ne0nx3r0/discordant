Yeah, the four kingdom thing kind of works out well as a number, heh.
3 is good too, but eh four works
Need to pick four cultures that did sort of coexist at one point in history
Like the Chinese, Mongols... Maybe some european influence
But they can't be too different or an alliance wont be very believable
Maybe like... 

1. Japanese / honor-based culture , lot of exotic weapons and a focus on lightning damage

2. Mongol / Horselord plains wanderers who recently settled down. Focus on defensive gear and heavy weapons

3. Nordic farming/academic society, focus on religion, healing, magic

Ooo maybe a greek culture; warm air, fanciful religion, very academically focused, lightweight  weapons but strong support magic.

 each culture might represent (not necessarily have items for) an element
Then there would be a fifth realm to do with the wishes whose "culture" represents chaos
So like the Gundarr are cold
Maybe there's a fire desert people, a thunder Japanese-esque culture of honorable ninjas and a physical central land where players start
Which could be like a plains area, something akin to the U.S. midwest. mild climate, people, etc.

Dual brother/sister crownship?

four cultures represent each damage type

--------------------------------------
Midlanders - farmers of the central plains
--------------------------------------
Basis: 

--------------------------------------
Gundarr - Beast riders of the North
--------------------------------------
Basis: Mongols

Items:
Spears and other long weapons they can use from their beasts
the beasts themselves fight
Bows that fire flaming arrows, require wishes to recharge
some mildly cold resistant armor, but solid physical resistance
jewels focus on damage resistance
Damage focus is physical, with some fire weapons(?)

Values:
- Might makes right
- Those who are not self-sufficient are fools who do not deserve to survive
- Extended family not valued but immediate family ties (parents, siblings, children) are sacred

Culture: 
- Leader known as the Darr
- Cold climate in the northern steppes
- Horselike beasts as pets
- mobile tent villages
- Superstitious but little serious interest in religion
- Little to no formal education, but scholars who can supply practical results from other cultures are highly valued
- Live off the land, sheep/goats for milk and meat
- During the creation of wishes the Darr's emisaries informed the king the Darr wanted to split the wish into four and give each kingdom, even brought a great chest to haul the expected great wish piece back in.
- After the destruction of the great wish they pulled back their mostly mobile villages into the mountains of their steppes, leaving the great beasts and demons to spread across the steppes. As time went on, they slowly took back parts of their former land, but the majority of the stepps is filled with high level critters and the remains of their great temples where the former Darrs were buried
- Greatest heroes kept demons as pets
