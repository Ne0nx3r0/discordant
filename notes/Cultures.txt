Yeah, the four kingdom thing kind of works out well as a number, heh.
3 is good too, but eh four works
Need to pick four cultures that did sort of coexist at one point in history
Like the Chinese, Mongols... Maybe some european influence
But they can't be too different or an alliance wont be very believable
Maybe like... 

1. Japanese / honor-based culture , lot of exotic weapons and a focus on lightning damage

2. Mongol / Horselord plains wanderers who recently settled down. Focus on defensive gear and heavy weapons

3. Nordic farming/academic society, focus on religion, healing, magic

Ooo maybe a greek culture; warm air, fanciful religion, very academically focused, lightweight  weapons but strong support magic.
