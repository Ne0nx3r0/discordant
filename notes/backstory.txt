So the idea is that a long time before the story starts a thing was invented, that let people get whatever they wanted. It was a bit like the concept of alchemy, you could use them to change things into something else or heal yourself or any other number of uses. They called the things "wishes". The first wishes were enormous, and had to be divided into smaller pieces for the average person.

But, there was a king who hoarded them, thinking if he kept enough of them he could fix all the problems of his four kingdoms. The king held a great conference with leaders from his lands and asked each what their people needed most. There was great contention over what to do with the wishes and they fought and argued until their voices were hoarse. 

Finally the exhausted king went to the vault where they kept the great wish, and stared into it, hopelessly uncertain of what to do. However, had he known more about the nature of wishes he might not have, because his uncertainty touched the wish and every thought and fear and hope he had poured into it causing it to erupt into a million unpredicable actions. Raw, untamed magic was brought into the world.

As the actions fell across the surface of the land the world was changed. Great demons rose from the earth and the elemental forces took shape burning themselves into the ores and creatures of the land. The chaos and conflicts between the four kingdoms that ensued doomed the land for hundreds of years. 

Centuries later as the people begin to rebuild their cities all but stories of the land that came before has been forgotten. Wishes exist now as miniscule pearlescent orbs, a mere shadow of what they once where. Yet, outside the safety of the cities the great treasures and the great demons of the old age still lurk.
