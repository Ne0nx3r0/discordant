"What would you risk to secure the future of your people?"

In ages past they were called wishes. Nothing was out of the reach of those who possessed them. 

But power does not grant wisdom. 

They were lost in the great miracles of their time.






Legends:
    It's said that long ago a great hero or a terrible villain committed an act which had such a profound impact on the memory of the world that the very memory of their deed calls fragments of it into existance. Over the eons spirit chasers hunted down the ghosts who remember these deeds and transcribed them onto stone tablets so that they might be called upon at will.
