Stone tablets is they contain "legends" that act as spells. During the great eruption there were all kinds of wars and battles fought against demons and each other, etc... Because the land was so alive with wishes everywhere, whenever great deeds happened those deeds were encoded into the stones surrounding where they happened, and the stones serve as a memory of the deeds. So by speaking the deed while holding the stone (aka casting the spell) you can call the legend into being. 

Granted, for the player that just means equipping the tablet as a weapon and doing like doffhand heal(edited)
And this is all centuries after the wish stuff, so the tablets are spread about and in use by everyday people
And one key thing I want to do is have the lore not be pushed into people's faces
Just the opposite, I want to hide it in items and areas, so they have to seek it out and figure it out for themselves
So like, we know the story and the world is built around it, but they have to piece it together
